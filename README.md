## Elevator Pitch

Imagine this...you've just graduated from something (high school, college, etc) and need to choose a place to live.  You have several requirements: large city, low-priced real estate, etc.  This command line program will ask you a few questions and then provide you with a few recommendations of places that may be a good fit for you.


## Project Requirements

  * Simple feature set
  * CRUD
  * Evidence of effective database querying using a SQL database

## Feature List:

   * I can enter preferences for a place to live
   * I can view recommendations for places I may want to live
   * I can change my preferences to view alternate recommendations.

## Interesting Query:

Figuring out the most cost effective (low cost of living, high wage) and least cost effective (high cost of living, low wage) places to live in a particular state or with a particular climate.
